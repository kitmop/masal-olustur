# Masal OluÅŸtur (Story Generator for Children)

Masal OluÅŸtur is a lightweight, API-based backend that generates personalized children's stories using LLMs (Large Language Models). It is designed as a minimal MVP to experiment with prompt engineering, FastAPI backend development, and voice synthesis integration.

## âœ¨ Features

- Custom story generation based on user inputs (e.g., character, setting, theme)
- LLM integration via OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent tone and age-appropriate language
- Planned support for ElevenLabs TTS (Text-to-Speech)
- Deployed on Railway for rapid access and testing

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **FastAPI** â€“ Lightweight, async Python backend
- **OpenAI API** â€“ For text generation
- **ElevenLabs API** â€“ For audio generation
- **Railway** â€“ Deployment platform
